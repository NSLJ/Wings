## Overview
### Description
Since the rise of hate-crimes, it is now more dangerous to be in public alone. With the goal to create a safer community, we developed Wings: an app that connects users to others when they feel unsafe in their current location. 

Connected users can be confirmed to have a safe "walking buddy" to get to safer common destinations. The app also includes other safety features such as: references to near registered "safe spots", warnings of areas with recent reported suspicious activity, and emergency functions to call campus police. 

With Wings, You Never Walk Alone. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Safety
- **Mobile:** Uses location and notifications
- **Story:** This app will help users feel safe in public given the rise in hate crimes.
- **Market:** CPP Students
- **Habit:** Users can use anytime on campus
- **Scope:** Wings will be pretty wide, as it will contain many elements and location matching. There is a lot of room to expand to include various other features. A narrow version of this won't include location but will still alert others when someone wants a walking buddy.
